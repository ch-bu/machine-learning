# Predicting Boston Housing Prices

This project is part of the [Machine Learning Nanodegree of Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). According to the [Project Overview](https://github.com/udacity/Project-Descriptions-for-Review/blob/master/Machine-Learning/Predicting%20Boston%20Housing%20Prices.md) the goal the following:

In this project, you will apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. You will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, you will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. You will then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable you to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, you will test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.

## My goal

After getting a first glimpse into numpy, pandas and matplotlib in the [Titanic Survival Exploration Project](https://github.com/ch-bu/udacity_titanic-survival-exploration) I try to improve solve another little machine learnig problem. My goal is to get acquainted with another supervised learning algorithms in a real project. I haven't mastered the concepts of variance and bias and cross-validation down cold yet. I want to fresh up on that.

The final project can be found [here](http://ch-bu.github.io/udacity/boston_housing.html).

## Run

Run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
